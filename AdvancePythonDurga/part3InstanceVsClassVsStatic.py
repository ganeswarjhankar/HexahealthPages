#Static method vs class method vs static method
#1.if we are using any instance variable inside mehtod body then we should go for instance method
#  we should call by using object reference only
#  2.if we are using only static variables inside method body then this  method no way related to particular
#  object we should declare such type of methods as class method.
#  we can call either by usng object reference or by using class name
